# Car_Following_Eval

This is the Git repository for the code used to study Car Following behavior in congestions. The paper is currently under review.

## Usage

This project uses Ananconda to maintain its virtual environments. First install Anaconda, and then you can create a virtual environment using one of the configuration files in env_config. Note that PyTorch is used to accelerate model simulations on Nvidia GPUs. 

Due to identifiable information stored in the IVBSS project database, data query scripts are only executable within the UMTRI building. To acquire data, refer to Data Availability section. 

### Data Availability
While all data loading and processing code is available, the actual data used in this study is from the IVBSS study, whose database is now maintained by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI). Data may be available upon request. Please contact UMTRI to obtain the raw data.
